  <h1>Instructions</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>
      We request you perform the session on a laptop and use either the Firefox
      or Chrome browser. Please do not use the back button during the course of
      this session.
    </li>
    <li>
      Please read these instructions carefully. Once you are done, click the
      "Continue" button.
    </li>
    <li>
      You should see a timer in the upper left corner. This timer indicates how
      much time you have left before you must be in the waiting room.
    </li>
    <li>On the next page, you will follow a tutorial to use the platform.</li>
    <li>
      Once you are done with the tutorial, you will be redirected to the waiting
      room. The "Ready" button will appear around the end of the countdown. <strong
        >Please do not leave the waiting room during this time.</strong
      > Once the button appears, please click on it to join the discussion. You will
      be given a minute to click on the button.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the discussion has enough participants to start, you will be redirected
      to the discussion. Please input a nickname when requested. <strong
        >Make sure you remember this nickname so you can record it during the
        survey.</strong
      > Please make sure your nickname does NOT have any personal identifiable information,
      such as your name or date of birth. There should be no way that your nickname
      can be traced back to you.
    </li>
    <li>
      You will be in the discussion room for 15 minutes with several other
      people. With this group, you will be solving the "Stranded" problem: <strong
        >identify and rank the top ten items the group should take if you all
        were stranded on an island for a long time.</strong
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      At the end of the discussion, you will be redirected to a survey. It
      should take approximately 10 minutes. After submitting the survey, you
      will be redirected to Prolific to indicate the completion of your session
      and the submission of your response.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the discussion does not have enough participants to start, you will be
      sent to a page that will let you redirect back to Prolific.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have any issues during the course of your session, please contact
      us at <a href="mailto:slzheng@andrew.cmu.edu">slzheng@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.

    <em>Payment</em>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you sign the consent form, participate in the discussion, and complete
      the survey, you will receive the full payment of $10.
    </li>
    <li>
      After the discussion and in the survey, you will be asked to report the
      items your group decided to include and say why youâ€™ve included each item.
      For each item that <em>all</em> members of the group reported was in the ranking
      with at least a sentence of justification, each member of the group will receive
      an additional 50 cents in bonus. Maximum $5 bonus from ten such items.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you sign the consent form and participate in the discussion but do not
      complete the survey for whatever reason, you will be given $5. Note that
      the survey will not be considered complete if you do not answer the
      required questions, or if the nickname you report you used in the
      discussion is invalid.
    </li>
    <li>
      You will receive $2.50 if you sign the consent form and make an effort to
      reach the waiting room, but are not able to reach the discussion in time
      or the study has too few people to continue to the discussion stage. If
      you do not consent to participate via the online consent form, you will
      not be given any compensation.
    </li>
  </ul>
