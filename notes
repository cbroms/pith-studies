TODO:
- redirect to completion link
- iFrame with discussion link
- instead of admin assuming ready, start, end works, should do a handshake
- save parameters better in server => have a session actually mean something
  so could theoretically host multiple discussions at once
- should probably return with success or error
- required questions that prevent one from continuing
- having instructions or something in waiting room
- check that no matter how user interacts with interface, is robust (i.e. the 
  if consent form checkboxes are closed/opened)
