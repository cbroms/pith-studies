TODO:
- extract pid from URL instead of entering it in
- check that no matter how user interacts with interface, is robust (i.e. the 
  if consent form checkboxes are closed/opened)
X change Cancelled to Start
X save parameters better in server => have a session actually mean something
  so could theoretically host multiple discussions at once
X iFrame with discussion link
X connect to atlas mongo with link above and change password!!!
X some mechanism to encourage people to click the ready button on waiting
X make buttons bigger and stuff easier to interact with
X having instructions or something in waiting room
X submitting a parameter causes complete rerender of page :(
X redirect to completion link
X instead of admin assuming ready, start, end works, should do a handshake
X should probably return with success or error
X required questions that prevent one from continuing
